This folder contains the input and output files for the OCSANA+ application example of reproducing results of [Zanudo et al., 2017](https://www.pnas.org/content/114/28/7234).

**zanudo.sif**: the gene regulatory network (GRN) file</br>
**FC_withsourcenodes**: the results of "FC without source nodes" algorithm from OCSANA+</br>
## SFA result files
The SFA result files contain the configuration of activated or inhibited nodes, and the steady state log values for all nodes in the network. 
**SFAresult_unperturbed**: the results of SFA with activation of Gata.a and Zic.r-a </br>
**SFAresult_adnze_epithelial**: the results of SFA with FC perturbation that yielded epithlial specifciation in Kobayshi et al., 2018</br>
**SFAresult_adnZe_brainpan**: the results of SFA with FC perturbation that yielded brain+pan-neural specifciation in Kobayshi et al., 2018</br>
**SFAresult_adNze_pannueral**: the results of SFA with FC perturbation that yielded pan-neural specifciation in Kobayshi et al., 2018</br>
**SFAresult_Adnze_endoderm**: the results of SFA with FC perturbation that yielded endoderm specifciation in Kobayshi et al., 2018</br>
**SFAresult_aDnze_notochord**: the results of SFA with FC perturbation that yielded notochord specifciation in Kobayshi et al., 2018</br>
**SFAresult_adnZE_mesenchyme**: the results of SFA with FC perturbation that yielded mesenchyme specifciation in Kobayshi et al., 2018</br>



**perturbation_logFCcalculation.xslx**: This sheet contains a summary of the SFA results for the cell fate specification nodes of interest, and the calcualted logFC results from SFA("perturbed log steady state value"-"unperturbed log steady state value")
